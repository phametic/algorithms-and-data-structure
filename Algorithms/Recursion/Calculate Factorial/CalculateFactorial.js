/*
    Write a function that returns the factorial of a number. 
    As a quick refresher, a factorial of a number is the result of that number 
    multiplied by the number before it, and the number before that number, and so on, until you reach 1. 
    The factorial of 1 is just 1.

    Sample:
    factorial(5); // 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 === 120
*/

function calculateFactorial(n) {
    if(n === 1) return 1;
    return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(calculateFactorial(5))
